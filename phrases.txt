do not walk too quickly
a fox is a very smart animal
a quarter of a century
we are subjects and must obey
wear a crown with many jewels
the quick brown fox jumped
our fax number has changed
my favorite subject is psychology
you are a wonderful example
watch out for low flying objects
he is just like everyone else
this is a non profit organization
one heck of a question
question that must be answered
fish are jumping
i am wearing a tie and a jacket
the dow jones index has risen
frequently asked questions
just in time for the party
reading week is just about here
no exchange without a bill
hands on experience with a job
this watch is too expensive
the kids are very excited
want to join us for lunch
win first prize in the contest
join us on the patio
these cookies are so amazing
what a lovely red jacket
quick there is someone knocking
zero in on the facts
universities are too expensive
go out for some pizza and beer
not quite so smart as you think
exceed the maximum speed limit
this leather jacket is too warm
consequences of a wrong turn
this system of taxation
i just cannot figure this out
tickets are very expensive
this equation is too complicated
express delivery is very fast
a good response to the question
prepare for the exam in advance
your etiquette needs some work
the objective of the exercise
did you see that spectacular explosion
keep receipts for all your expenses
traveling requires a lot of fuel
a good joke deserves a good laugh
never mix religion and politics
the fax machine is broken
february has an extra day
that is a very odd question
the hopes of a new organization
just like it says on the can good
bring the offenders to justice
a subject one can really enjoy
i like baroque and classical music
try to enjoy your maternity leave
dinosaurs have been extinct for ages
an injustice is committed every day
prescription drugs require a note
our life expectancy has increased
quit while you are ahead
good jobs for those with education
jumping right out of the water
an excellent way to communicate
presidents drive expensive cars
the stock exchange dipped
why do you ask silly questions
apartments are too expensive
just what the doctor ordered
exercise is good for the mind
most judges are very honest
questioning the wisdom of the courts
rejection letters are discouraging
that referendum asked a silly question
experience is hard to come by
